# Welcome to Parent Guidebook made by David Quindoza!

 ---

I made this web guide for you in order to help you in doing things related to computers and mobile phones that normally I would be tasked around the house.

Since I may not be able at all times, this guide provides you a step by step tutorial on most of the things I do for you:


- Pay Bills Online
- Transfer Money Online (UnionBank/BPI)
- How to Scan/ Print
- Order Food
- Book a Lalamove order

## How to use this guide

On the left side of the website is the **Navigation menu**, just click which tutorial you would like to see. You can also use the top right **search icon**. 

I also provided the list of necessary information and account list on the Family PC. It is below the icon for this guide in your desktop.
