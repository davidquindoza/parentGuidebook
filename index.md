- Pay Bills Online
- Transfer Money Online (UnionBank/BPI)
- How to Scan/ Print

## How to use this guide

On the left side of the website is the **Navigation menu**, just click which tutorial you would like to see. You can also use the top right **search icon**. 

I also provided the list of necessary information and account list on the Family PC. It is below the icon for this guide in your desktop.
