### Step 1. Open food Panda App and Set Address

To start ordering food from the foodpanda app, set your address first to your location. Your food will be delivered to this location. 

**(I have already set the address on your mobile phones so you can skip this step).**  However, you can continue reading to learn more about this step.

To put a meal in our cart **tap on selected meal** (Classic Healthy Plate).

Then tap **add to cart**, you may opt for additional options for your meal as well.

This will bring a window on the status of your order, usually in a sequence of:

**Take note that you need to check your phone on the status of your order once in a while because the rider might call you for directions or is already outside**

Enjoy your food!
